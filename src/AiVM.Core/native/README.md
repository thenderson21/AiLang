# AiVM Native Core

## Purpose

`src/AiVM.Core/native` contains the clean C rewrite scaffold of the AiVM deterministic core. This is structural scaffolding and not yet a feature-complete VM host/runtime replacement.

## Deterministic VM Goal

The VM core is a pure state transition engine:

- deterministic instruction dispatch
- explicit VM state container
- no hidden side effects
- no global mutable state
- no time, randomness, threads, or OS calls in VM core

## Host Separation

The VM does not implement host behavior directly. Syscalls are external and invoked through a typed handler function pointer. This keeps the host mechanical and preserves syscall boundary clarity.

## Why C

C provides a thin, portable, embeddable runtime foundation:

- straightforward embedding across host environments
- no managed runtime dependency in the VM core
- explicit control over memory ownership and state flow

## Semantics Authority

AiLang semantics remain governed by the AiLang specification (`SPEC/IL.md`, `SPEC/EVAL.md`, `SPEC/VALIDATION.md`).

This scaffold does not introduce new language semantics or runtime behavior.

## Utility

`aivm_parity_cli` is provided as an initial harness utility to compare two text outputs using deterministic normalization (CRLF/LF normalization and trailing newline trimming).

`aivm_runtime.h` provides host-bridge execution APIs:

- `aivm_execute_program(...)`
- `aivm_execute_program_with_syscalls(...)`
- `aivm_execute_program_with_syscalls_and_argv(...)`

`aivm_runtime.h` also provides host adapter helpers for deterministic event queue integration:

- `aivm_runtime_host_enqueue_event(...)`
- `aivm_runtime_host_drain_events(...)`

Adapter contract:

- VM semantic state mutation remains owner-thread only.
- Worker/host threads may produce events, but they must enqueue through host adapter callbacks.
- Drain step is explicit and bounded (`max_events`) to keep deterministic sequencing at host boundary.
- Adapter failures map to explicit statuses:
  - `AIVM_RUNTIME_HOST_EVENT_OK`
  - `AIVM_RUNTIME_HOST_EVENT_INVALID`
  - `AIVM_RUNTIME_HOST_EVENT_REJECTED`

Local host integration shape:

1. Provide `AivmRuntimeHostAdapter` with `enqueue` and `drain` callbacks plus host context.
2. Use `aivm_execute_program_with_syscalls*` to run VM steps with syscall bindings.
3. Route external events into `aivm_runtime_host_enqueue_event(...)`.
4. On owner-thread loop, call `aivm_runtime_host_drain_events(...)` and apply drained events in deterministic order.

`aivm_syscall_contracts.h` provides deterministic typed syscall-contract validation scaffolding.
`aivm_c_api.h` provides a C-ABI-friendly execution entrypoint for host integration.

## Build and Test

From repository root:

```bash
./scripts/test-aivm-c.sh
```

Direct preset usage from `src/AiVM.Core/native`:

```bash
cmake --preset aivm-native-unix --fresh
cmake --build --preset aivm-native-unix-build
ctest --preset aivm-native-unix-test
```

Common focused presets:

- `aivm-native-unix-test-unit`
- `aivm-native-unix-test-integration`
- `aivm-native-unix-test-parity`
- `aivm-native-unix-test-host`
- `aivm-native-unix-test-wasm`
- `aivm-native-windows-test-unit`
- `aivm-native-windows-test-integration`
- `aivm-native-windows-test-parity`
- `aivm-native-windows-test-host`

Optional environment variables:

- `AIVM_C_BUILD_DIR`: override CMake build directory (default `.tmp/aivm-c-build-native`)
- `AIVM_PARITY_REPORT`: override parity manifest report path
- `AIVM_BUILD_SHARED=1`: enable shared-library build in the test flow

For normalized output comparison in dual-run workflows:

```bash
./scripts/aivm-parity-compare.sh <left-output-file> <right-output-file>
```

For command-driven dual-run comparison:

```bash
./scripts/aivm-dualrun-parity.sh "<left-command>" "<right-command>"
```
